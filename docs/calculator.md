# Inline calculator

`Core/Calculator/` is a **Foundation-only** engine (no AppKit / SwiftUI imports) fronted by
`CalcMemo`, a one-deep memo mirroring `AppIndex`'s. It must stay Foundation-only because the
`Tools/calc-test.swift` harness compiles the real engine sources — including `CalcDateTime`. It is
also **pure**: the one input it can't compute, the FX rate table, is passed in (see Currency below).

## Evaluation pipeline

`CalcEngine.evaluate` runs:

1. Natural-language date/time (`CalcDateTime`, e.g. `hrs till 9am`, `days till 9april`,
   `today + 3 weeks`)
2. Numeric reject
3. Tokenize
4. Base conversion
5. Explicit unit conversion (`10km to mi`)
6. **Currency conversion** (`1 euro to dollars`, `€20 to GBP`, and — with the second toggle on —
   coins: `1 btc in usd`, `0.5 eth to eur`)
7. **Bare-unit auto-conversion** (`1m` → feet + inches, `1hr` → 60 min, via
   `CalcUnits.parseBareConversion` + the `autoTargets` map)
8. Plain arithmetic

### Operator notes

- **Scientific notation** (`1e3`, `2.5e-3`) is consumed only when a digit — optionally signed —
  follows the `e`. A bare `e` stays Euler's constant, so `2e` is still 2 × e and `3 exabytes` keeps
  its unit intact.
- **Modulo is the word `mod`** (`17 mod 5`), not `%`, because a bare `%` is the percent postfix
  (`250 + 15%`). Internally it rides on the `%` operator *character*, which is free precisely
  because percent is handled in `parsePostfix` and never reaches `peekBinary`. Same precedence as
  `*` and `/`.
- A lone literal returns no card at all — `2.5e-3` on its own is more likely an app search than a
  calculation. It needs to be part of an expression (`2.5e-3 * 1000`).

Date/time depends on the clock, so it takes an injected `now` / `calendar` — the public `evaluate(_:)`
uses the live clock, and `evaluate(_:now:calendar:)` lets `calc-test.swift` assert exact strings
against a fixed clock.

## Currency

`CalcCurrency` mirrors `CalcUnits`' shape: a lookup table plus a `parseConversion` over the same
`expr from (to|in|->) to` token shape, so `eur to usd` implies an amount of 1 exactly like `m to ft`.
A leading sign is swapped back into amount-first order, so `€20 to GBP` and `20€ to GBP` parse alike.

The table is **generated except for the judgement calls**. `node Tools/gen-currencies.js` joins two
sources on the ISO code and emits `CurrencyData.generated.swift`:

- **Frankfurter** decides which currencies exist — the same feed the rates come from, so the table
  can never list something the app can't price. 165 codes.
- **CLDR** (`en`) decides what humans call them: display name, currency sign, singular/plural noun.
  Read from the pinned `cldr-json` checkout, not the host's `Intl`, whose output shifts with the
  local ICU version.

Only *unambiguous* CLDR data is emitted — 26 signs and 128 nouns. CLDR itself supplies the sign
tie-break: it writes every dollar but USD as `CA$`/`A$`/`NT$`, so plain `$` is claimed by exactly one
currency. Bare Latin letters CLDR lists as symbols (`P` for BWP, `L` for HNL) are dropped, since a
letter is indistinguishable from a word to the tokenizer. Accented nouns are emitted both as written
and folded, so `krónur` and `kronur` both resolve. The noun itself is the name's last word, which is
only wrong where that word isn't one — `NOT_NOUNS` in the generator drops those ("Special Drawing
Rights" is not a "rights").

What's left hand-written in `CalcCurrency.swift` is one table, `contested`: the nouns several
currencies share, where CLDR correctly refuses to choose and the calculator must. `dollars` is
claimed by 22 currencies, `francs` 10, `pounds` 9, `pesos` 8, `rupees` 6. CLDR says "US dollars" and
"Canadian dollars"; nothing in it says a bare "dollars" is USD. Words that stay genuinely ambiguous
are assigned to nobody — `krona` is both SEK and ISK, so it produces no card. Slang and synonyms
(`quid`, `bucks`, `rmb`) are deliberately *not* carried: they'd be hand-maintained data with no
source of truth.

Order is the whole disambiguation story. Currency runs **after** the unit path, so a query both sides
of which are compatible units stays a measurement: `10 pounds to kg` is weight, `10 pounds to euros`
is money, and `1 cup to ml` stays volume even though `CUP` is the Cuban peso. A currency on one side
and a unit on the other produces the same friendly category error as any other mismatch
(`Cannot convert Currency to Weight.`).

### Consent

Currency conversion reaches the network, so it ships **off** and stays off until the user turns it on
in Settings → Miscellaneous and accepts a sheet naming the provider, the request cadence and what
leaves the machine. Declining leaves it off; there is no "remind me later" state. Any future feature
that needs the network should follow the same shape rather than inventing a second one.

The gate is a type, not a boolean sprinkled around: `CalcEngine.evaluate` takes a `CurrencySource`
that is either `.off` or `.on(CurrencyRates?)`, and it **defaults to `.off`**, so a caller that
forgets to pass one gets the feature disabled rather than silently enabled. `.off` makes
`CalcCurrency.parseConversion` return nil before it parses anything, so a currency query produces no
card at all — not even the category-mismatch error, which would leak that the feature exists.
`.on(nil)` is the consented-but-not-yet-downloaded state, and that is what earns the "rates
unavailable" message.

`CurrencyRateStore` re-checks consent at every entry point rather than trusting a caller: reading the
cache at init, the `source` the engine is handed, `start()`, each turn of the refresh loop, and twice
around the network call itself — once before the request and once after the `await`, since consent
can be withdrawn while a response is in flight. Revoking cancels the loop, drops the snapshot and
deletes the cached file. The flag lives on the store, deliberately *not* in `AppSettings`:
`SettingsBackup` mirrors that type field-for-field, and importing a config must never be able to
grant network access.

For "revoking deletes the rates" to be true there has to be exactly one copy, so the fetch runs on a
private **cacheless** `URLSession` (`.ephemeral`, `urlCache = nil`) rather than `URLSession.shared`.
The provider serves the table `Cache-Control: public, max-age=…`, so the shared session would store a
second copy in the on-disk `URLCache` that deleting `currency-rates.json` doesn't touch.

Rates come from `CurrencyRateStore` (`Core/`, owned by `AppCore`), which reads
[Frankfurter](https://frankfurter.dev) — open source, no key, no account, no quota, rates blended
from 84 central banks. One `GET api.frankfurter.dev/v2/rates?base=USD`, ~1.4 KB gzipped. v2 answers
with one flat `{date, base, quote, rate}` row per pair rather than a keyed table, and omits the
base's own row — the store folds both into the `[code: rate]` shape `CurrencyRates` stores.

The table is cached at `~/Library/Caches/<bundle-id>/currency-rates.json`, refreshed every 24h with a
15-minute retry after a failure. The feed republishes about once a day, so a tighter interval would
cost requests without returning newer numbers. Age is measured from the persisted `fetchedAt`, not
from launch, so relaunching Tinycast never re-fetches a snapshot that is still fresh — a cold start
with a same-day cache makes zero requests. Offline, the last snapshot keeps answering; with no snapshot at all
the card says so rather than guessing, and a currency the feed doesn't quote reports
`No exchange rate for <CODE>.` The store hands `CalcEngine.evaluate` a finished `CurrencyRates`
value — the engine never fetches, which is what keeps it Foundation-only and testable. `CalcMemo`
keys its memo on the snapshot's `fetchedAt`, so a fresh table re-evaluates without diffing every rate.

Money rounds to two decimals (`CalcFormatter.currency`), widening to four significant digits below a
cent — in *plain* notation, deliberately not `%g`, so `1 IDR to USD` reads `0.00005539 USD` rather
than `5.539e-05`.

## Result and rendering

`CalcResult` carries an `expression` (left), a `display` / `copyText` payload (right), and optional
`sourceBadge` / `targetBadge` word-name pills. `CalculatorCard` renders it as a two-column card.

When the launcher or Calculator History query evaluates to a result the card is pinned at the top of
the list (flat selection index 0, shifting rows by one) and Enter copies the answer + records it to
`CalculatorHistoryStore`.
